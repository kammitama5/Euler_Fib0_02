# Euler_Fib0_02
working through the problems. 
This one is:

// By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
//1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89
//By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence
//whose values do not exceed four million,
//find the sum of the even valued terms


// I sort of cheated with this one, and found the value that was just below 
//a result that gave 4 mill, and found the sum by mapping over an array

// I got 4613732. Hey, it works.
